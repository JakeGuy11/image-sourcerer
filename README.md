*Image Sourcerer* is a browser extension supported on Chrome and Chrome extension based browsers that is designed to download, sort and track images from supported sites. Once complete, this application will help users download images from content-rich sites, letting them control how it is organized and keeping track of the original creators for future reference.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

Unfortunately, due to some unexpected circumstances and the natural progression of my educational journey, this project is (and is planned to remain) unmaintained. I would like to thank everyone for their support and dedication to the project. The only constant in life is change, but that won't stop me from holding dear everything that came before.

~~We are currently looking for beta testers! Find out more [here](https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/blob/main/beta-testing.md)!~~

# Installation
1. Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/releases) OR download the lasted commit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer.git
# or
git clone git@github.com:JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer.git
```
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser. Other brosers that support chrome extensions will usually redirect you to their specific extension pages.
3. You will have to enable developer mode by toggling the switch usually in the upper right corner. Click "Load Unpacked", navigate to where you saved the repository and select open.
5. Open any supported site. The extension should now be functional.
# Supported Sites
We'll have to see (nothing at the moment, as all scripts must be updated).
